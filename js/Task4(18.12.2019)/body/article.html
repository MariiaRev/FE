        <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
        <p>Back in 2003 (that's <span id="zengarden-age">a lot of</span> years ago!) <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a> launched the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com"><cite><abbr>CSS</abbr> Zen Garden</cite></a>. It showcased what was possible with <abbr>CSS</abbr>-based designs, leading to an explosion in the use of CSS on the web. Then, <a href="http://qfox.nl">Peter van der Zee</a> created <a href="http://js1k.com">JS1k</a> in 2010, a competition to build cool applications with no more than 1 <abbr>K</abbr> of JavaScript.</p>
        <p>A lot has happened since the Zen Garden days, and today you can do almost anything with only <abbr>CSS</abbr>. As <abbr>CSS</abbr> use is growing, so is the average <abbr>CSS</abbr> file size. Popular sites have in average <a href="http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage">75 <abbr>K</abbr> of <abbr>CSS</abbr></a>, but some use up to a megabyte of style sheets!</p>
        <p>Do we need that much? <b>CSS1K</b> invites you to show that web developers are more inventive than ever, and that limitations can sparkle creativity.</p>
